    - Realized that the main board can not supply 5V when the USB is not connected.
    - Added a `TPS61023` 5V boost converter to generate 5V from the 3.3V input.
    - Removed the 5V load switch since the 5V output can not be controlled via the boost converter.
    - The 5V converter enabled by default with a GPIO control.
    - Added `LM66100DCKR` single-channel ideal diode to connect the VBUS to the 5V rail.
